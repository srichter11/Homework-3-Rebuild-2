App shows modal view controller and a table

In this app i used performseguewithidentifier to conduct segues with code instead of direct links between actions on the storyboard. 

I also used the addtarget method to initialize the function and presented a modal view

In the table view section, i created a new subclass with a color and overrode the super class to be able to display this information
as the last line in the table
